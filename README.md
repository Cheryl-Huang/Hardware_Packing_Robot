# Packaging Robot

## About the Project
The project designs and fabricates a system that packages different types of fasteners into a box with eight compartments, with the number as well as the type of fasteners, and the location in the box specified by the user.

## About the Program
The program aims to provide control signal to the overall machine, to ensure that each component of the machine is operating in a desired manner and at a desired time, so that all components collaborate to achieve the functionality of the robot. This is done by reading signal inputs to the microcontroller board from sensors, processing the logic, and activating the actuators as required. The microcontroller board used for the project is Pic18F4620. Software is developed to perform the sorting, dispensing, and rotating operation of the packaging machiene, as well as the logic requried for keypad and display interface.
